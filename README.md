# AWCRAFT!
This is my attempt to build a fully operational Minecraft server in the Cloud, more specifically AWS!
 If you don't know what AWS is, you can find here: [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
# What I did so far
  Here, at my first upload to the internet, I've set up the entire AWS account (more on that [in this tutorial](soon) **SOON**
  More than that, I've implemented a Discord bot, that allows me to **turn my server on and off**, and even change into Minecraft vanilla to ModPacks
For the Discord, I've used **THIS** [API](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) from [RAPPTZ](https://github.com/Rapptz)
	The bot is running on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
# What I'm doing now
 For now, I'm studying AWS automation with [Boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) and planning to improve the Discord bot to recive options from "**.json**" files
